# Meta — improve the harness, extend the reach

Run when a flow repeats, when the task needs a domain the harness lacks, or when
asked to improve the harness itself. The harness compounds or it rots.

## 1. Skillify (promote repeated flows)

When the same flow runs for the third time, offer to promote it into the harness:

1. Name the trigger (what prompt shape fires it) and the done-test.
2. Write the steps at section density: under 120 lines, no story, rules not prose.
3. Wire the router row in `SKILL.md` and the section file in `sections/`.
4. Rehearse it once on a real task before it counts as part of the harness.

A promoted flow that nobody fires within a month gets cut. The harness stays
proportional to the work actually done.

## 2. Extend (borrow, do not improvise)

When the task needs a domain the harness lacks (a framework, a platform, a
specialty), look outward before improvising:

1. Search the skills ecosystem (`npx skills find <keywords>`, plus the leaderboard
   at skills.sh for well-known domains).
2. Verify before recommending: prefer 1K+ installs; trusted sources
   (vendor-official, major-maintainer) over unknown authors; check repo stars —
   under ~100 stars is treated with skepticism.
3. Present: name, what it does, installs + source, install command, link.
4. Offer to install. Never auto-install; the user approves every addition.

If nothing vetted exists, say so and work from primary sources
(`sections/browse.md` §2) instead of pretending a skill covered it.

## 3. Evolve (change the harness safely)

Harness edits follow the same discipline as product edits: router changes get the
day-rehearsal (one prompt per phase, correct mode each time); new sections get a
real-task rehearsal; strip and critic checks re-run after any save/review change.
A harness change without its rehearsal is not done.
